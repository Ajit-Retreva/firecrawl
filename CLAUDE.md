Firecrawl is a web scraper API. The directory you have access to is a monorepo:
 - `apps/api` has the actual API and worker code
 - `apps/*-sdk` are various SDKs

When making changes to the API, here are the general steps you should take:
1. Write some end-to-end tests that assert your win conditions, if they don't already exist
  - 1 happy path (more is encouraged if there are multiple happy paths with significantly different code paths taken)
  - 1+ failure path(s)
  - Generally, E2E (called `snips` in the API) is always preferred over unit testing.
  - In the API, always use `scrapeTimeout` from `./lib` to set the timeout you use for scrapes.
  - These tests will be ran on a variety of configurations. You should gate tests in the following manner:
    - If it requires fire-engine: `!process.env.TEST_SUITE_SELF_HOSTED`
    - If it requires AI: `!process.env.TEST_SUITE_SELF_HOSTED || process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || process.env.OLLAMA_BASE_URL`
2. Write code to achieve your win conditions
3. Run your tests using `pnpm harness jest ...`
  - `pnpm harness` is a command that gets the API server and workers up for you to run the tests. Don't try to `pnpm start` manually.
  - The full test suite takes a long time to run, so you should try to only execute the relevant tests locally, and let CI run the full test suite.
4. Push to a branch, open a PR, and let CI run to verify your win condition.
Keep these steps in mind while building your TODO list.

Never bypass `knip` failures (e.g. with `git commit --no-verify`). If the pre-commit `knip` check fails, fix the reported unused exports/files — even if they predate your change — before committing.

## Engineering standard: Karpathy coding rules

Source: CLAUDE.md in [forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills). Adopted as the Retreva engineering standard. The project-specific instructions above take priority where they conflict.
Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
